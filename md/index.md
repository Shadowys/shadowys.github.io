##Making miracles come true near you.

###A Pinch of Salt and Pepper

Most of my work is done in [Python](https://www.python.org/), but recently I have started writing in [D](http://dlang.org/) for speed of execution, like parsing a html file to find dates for a program patch, or writing a program that calls [7z](http://www.7-zip.org/) to zip files. In [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/), my scripts are bilingual, in [C Sharp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx) and [Boo](http://boo.codehaus.org/). I like programming in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) for the fun and challenge it brings.

###Hot Sparks Fly

Currently I'm working on the [Blitz repo](https://github.com/Shadowys/Blitz) which hosts the script sources for the [Zoid-MMORPG](http://shadowys.github.io/Zoids-MMORPG). 
Working on a game has been a fun experience for me, I mean, I never knew just writing and marketing a game would get me to know .NET, C#, Boo, HTML/CSS/JS, a dash of Python and D here and there. So, yeah, it's been awesome.

###Subtle svbtle

I like blogger in that it is complete...ly not suited for posting code. Markdown is the way to go, since posting a lot of CSS/JS code repetitively is not the way I want it. Svbtle provides using markdown to write stuff. Though, that's it. Just writing stuff, no way for users to provide feedback, nothing. That said, I might use this place as a mini blog. :D
