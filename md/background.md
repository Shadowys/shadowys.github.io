I grew up, and did development with Windows boxes. There, I said it, the most horrifying line you've ever heard. 

Okay, it's not very horrifying, sice Windows is, apparently for the laymen, the [most user-friendly one](http://www.thetoptens.com/best-operating-systems/), at least until it comes to shell scripting, but then again, I prefer Python for most tasks anyway. 

My interest in programming came when I was around 13 years of age. Somehow, I just found the computer to be a fascinating object. It is capable of doing anything we tell it to do, as long as we tell it to do it properly with a computer language. So I found myself reading a book on C++ and the [website from Alex](http://www.cprogramming.com/), downloading Code Blocks as recommended and started coding. It went well until I hit pointers.

You know, the one with these signs: * and & . There's an excellent showcase of what pointers can do and their function from [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000319.html)

It didn't take long for my brain to crash. In hindsight, pointers are extremely useful for getting around low level tasks but generally higher level tasks would avoid pointers as much as possible, unless it gives a better advantage, like the string concatenation task in the Joel Spolsky link.

After that it was an on-off relationship with Java (abandoned due to the inability for me to download the JavaSDK) and C++(finally got around pointers but it turned boring with so many things to type), until the year I turned 16, and I met Python.

Heck yeah.

It isn't that I don't like C++, but I dislike the verbosity of programming languages. It's like teaching a one year old to write an essay on how to cook marsh-mellows, and tasty ones at that. The compiler should be clever enough not to get in my way and do all those mundane tasks automatically, unless I explicitly tells it otherwise. Though this was before I met [D](http://www.dlang.org), but Python struck a chord with me (the library rocxxx!!) and I have happily gone down that path for two years, writing a tic tac toe game with a rudimentary AI among other things. 

After that I was finding a project to do in [CodeCall](http://forum.codecall.net/) and I met blackie/a6yog saying something about making Zoids MMORPG. It was intermittent, but eventually I got the hang of the libraries available in the unity3D engine, along with reading plenty of code, including bad ones from my own code
