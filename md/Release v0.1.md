Posted on 13th June 2014

The alpha-alpha-alpha version has been [released](http://shadowys.github.io/Zoids-MMORPG/downloads.html)! I'm so excited, even though I'm feeling pessimistic at the same time. While the game has most of the functions written out, we're low on models, textures and sounds, so the overall game-play experience might not be on par on what most people would expect. 

Also, the multi-player is still buggy in that the audio and visual cues does not work over the network, so that might need to be taken care by RPCs which updates all the pipes and gears (scripts that hold the data) over the network. 

Nevertheless, it was one fun month of a whirlwind romance with Unity, Photon, .NET, along with Boo and then C Sharp, discovering Svbtle and Github, along with a pinch of HTML/CSS/JS, Python and D (REGEX ROCXXX!!!!:P) here and there.

It's been great working with a6yog (our project manager and CEO :P), dragondude28 (First 3D model Liger Zero we used in our game), thecoins (Second model that was consistent with the style, so we used it until now), Lee (Your experience is golden. :D), Kam (Enthusiastic and great guy! Kinda reminds me when I just started to write the game :P), and other forum members who has provided insights, bug reports (OMG this I appreciate extremely much as a programmer), and ideas for the game.

I'm working on a Launcher (Python! Tkinter! Everything and more in PyLibs! :P) for the game next, while I'm delegating multi-player, weapons and GUI to Thomas, Kam and Lee respectively if possible.
